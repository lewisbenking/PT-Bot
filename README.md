- The project consists of a character model with an animation, a button and a video canvas.
- When you click the button, the video will start playing and the character model will turn and point to the video. 
- When the video stops playing, the character model will return to the default idle animation.
- I've started writing the scripts to connect to the DialogFlow chatbot, I need to make some more modifications before I can start testing the connection.
- I've tested connecting to the DialogFlow API using Postman and have successfully sent POST requests and received responses.
