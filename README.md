- I've created a character in Fuse, and added an Idle animation with Mixamo.
- I have imported the character in Unity. I ran into issues with transparency but this is now fixed.
- I created an animation in Unity where the character model will rotate and his arm will rotate.
- This animation means he will turn and point at the canvas (where the video will play).
- The current project consists of the character model, the canvas and a button.
- When you click the button, the video will start playing and the character model will turn and point to the video. 
- When the video stops playing, the character model will return to the default idle animation.
- I've started writing the scripts to connect to the DialogFlow chatbot, I need to make some more modifications before I can start testing the connection.
- I've tested connecting to the DialogFlow API using Postman and have successfully sent POST requests and received responses.
